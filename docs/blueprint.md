# **App Name**: ArchSim

## Core Features:

- Desktop Environment: Simulate a desktop environment resembling Arch Linux with Hyperland, including window management, theming, and basic utilities.
- Interactive Terminal: Implement a fully functional, interactive terminal emulator within the browser, supporting common Arch Linux commands.
- Theme Customization: Offer a variety of pre-built themes inspired by popular Arch Linux setups. Provide ability for the user to create new color schemes
- Responsive Design: Ensure the entire application is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
- File System Exploration: Emulate basic file system navigation, allowing users to 'browse' a simulated directory structure with view-only capability for basic file types.
- Generative Assistance: Incorporate an AI-powered tool that assists users with command discovery and usage. It provides suggestions and explanations based on user input in the terminal.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#4B0082) evoking sophistication and system stability.
- Background color: Dark Gray (#282828) a desaturated variant of the primary hue at around 20% saturation, creating a backdrop that reduces eye strain and puts the focus on interactive elements.
- Accent color: Electric Purple (#BF00FF), an analogous hue to the primary that will draw attention to points of interaction within the simulated environment, such as active terminal prompts.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface selected for its modern appearance and readability on screen, perfect for user interface elements and code rendering within the terminal.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for accurate display within the simulated terminal.
- Utilize minimalist icons inspired by modern Linux desktop environments, maintaining a clean and consistent aesthetic.
- Employ a modular and customizable layout, allowing users to arrange virtual windows and panels to suit their preferences. Provide default arrangements that mimic popular tiling window managers.
- Integrate subtle animations, particularly for window transitions and terminal interactions, to enhance the overall user experience and provide visual feedback without being distracting.
